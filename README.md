# PAN Card Tampering Detection App

## Overview  
This **Streamlit-based web app** allows users to compare an **original** and a **tampered** PAN card image to detect modifications using **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**. It highlights the differences and provides a similarity score to determine if tampering has occurred.  

## Features  
✅ Upload an **original** and a **tampered** PAN card.  
✅ Calculates the **SSIM score** to compare image similarity.  
✅ Highlights **differences** using **bounding boxes**.  
✅ Displays the **original, tampered, difference map, and thresholded images**.  
✅ Uses **OpenCV & Scikit-Image** for image processing.
